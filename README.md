Small project that try to bend to world.

May not be fully working, but should provide an improvable starting point.

# How to
The only important file is src/bend
The other are a poc for a cubish project that I let there as it may serve a nice demo.

All the required doc is in src/bend

Beware that tis is still mostly a test, and there is many point were it can be improved

# Notes
Yes, it uses an hardcoded path to get bevy.
Had to do that to workaround some weird crevice issues I did not wanted to investigate further.

Working with bevy at 9f47697e
Did not tryed since newer upgrade, and as it is in active development I would expect it to fail compilation
